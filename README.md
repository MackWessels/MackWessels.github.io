# Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a results-driven **software developer** with a strong background in **full-stack web development**, **systems programming**, and **game design**.  
I focus on building reliable, scalable, and user-friendly software that combines clean design with efficient logic.

My experience spans technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, **MySQL**, **C**, and **Godot**, and I’m always eager to learn new tools that improve performance and usability.  
Whether it’s optimizing a database query or designing a responsive interface, I enjoy finding practical solutions that make an impact.


## Featured Projects

### 1. HelixHunt  
A sophisticated web application for querying genetic variation data, built with React and Node.js. HelixHunt integrates with the ClinVar database to ensure data availability, even during site outages. Key features include an intuitive query builder, efficient data handling with MySQL, and a modern, responsive interface.

### 2. Tower Defense Game  
A 3D tower defense game built in Godot using GDScript, featuring procedurally generated tile-based maps, dynamic enemy pathfinding, and a variety of unique towers such as Tesla, Sniper, and Mortar. The game incorporates a flow-field system for real-time enemy navigation, resource management with minerals and shards, and meta-upgrades for persistent progression. This project highlights my skills in game design, algorithm development, and system balancing.

### 3. Scheduling Algorithms Simulator  
A project focused on implementing and visualizing different process scheduling algorithms in C. The simulator supports First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round-Robin (RR). It provides insights into how different algorithms manage tasks and optimize CPU performance.

### 4. Sudoku Solver  
A program that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms. It includes features like puzzle generation, validation, and user interaction. This project reflects my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic complexity.

## About Me

I earned my **B.S. in Computer Science** from **Charleston Southern University**, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical problem-solving and creative design.  
My projects reflect a hands-on approach to software engineering—planning, coding, testing, and refining each system to deliver quality results.

I’m currently seeking opportunities to **build and improve software systems**, collaborate with experienced teams, and continue growing as a developer.
