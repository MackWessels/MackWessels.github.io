Portfolio Overview
Welcome to my portfolio! This collection showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my skills in software development, web applications, and algorithmic problem-solving. My work emphasizes creating efficient, intuitive, and well-designed solutions using modern technologies.

Featured Projects
1. HelixHunt
A sophisticated web application for querying genetic variation data, built with React and Node.js. HelixHunt integrates with the ClinVar database to ensure data availability, even during site outages. Key features include an intuitive query builder, efficient data handling with MySQL, and a modern, responsive interface.

2. Scheduling Algorithms Simulator
A project focused on implementing and visualizing different process scheduling algorithms in C. The simulator supports First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round-Robin (RR). It provides insights into how different algorithms manage tasks and optimize CPU performance.

3. FunRun
An engaging and interactive game developed to explore game mechanics and design principles. The project showcases concepts such as player movement, collision detection, and real-time updates. It highlights my ability to blend coding and creativity to deliver a fun user experience.

4. Sudoku Solver
A program that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms. It includes features like puzzle generation, validation, and user interaction. This project reflects my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic complexity.
