# Portfolio Overview

Welcome to my portfolio! This collection showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my skills in software development, web applications, and algorithmic problem-solving. My work emphasizes creating efficient, intuitive, and well-designed solutions using modern technologies.

## Featured Projects

### 1. HelixHunt  
A sophisticated web application for querying genetic variation data, built with React and Node.js. HelixHunt integrates with the ClinVar database to ensure data availability, even during site outages. Key features include an intuitive query builder, efficient data handling with MySQL, and a modern, responsive interface.

### 2. Tower Defense Game  
A 3D tower defense game built in Godot using GDScript, featuring procedurally generated tile-based maps, dynamic enemy pathfinding, and a variety of unique towers such as Tesla, Sniper, and Mortar. The game incorporates a flow-field system for real-time enemy navigation, resource management with minerals and shards, and meta-upgrades for persistent progression. This project highlights my skills in game design, algorithm development, and system balancing.

### 3. Scheduling Algorithms Simulator  
A project focused on implementing and visualizing different process scheduling algorithms in C. The simulator supports First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round-Robin (RR). It provides insights into how different algorithms manage tasks and optimize CPU performance.

### 4. Sudoku Solver  
A program that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms. It includes features like puzzle generation, validation, and user interaction. This project reflects my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic complexity.
