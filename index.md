Portfolio
=========
I’m a software developer focused on building reliable, creative, and user-centered solutions. This portfolio highlights projects completed during my B.S. in Computer Science and beyond, showcasing work in systems programming, full-stack development, and game design. I bring experience with C, C++, Java, SQL, React, and Godot, and I’m eager to continue applying these skills in software engineering roles.

  <summary>My Coding Journey</summary>
My journey began as a Computer Science student eager to understand how technology works at every level, from low-level systems to user-facing applications. Through coursework and personal projects, I developed strong skills in problem-solving, algorithm design, and collaborative development. Along the way, I explored languages like C++, Java, and C, while also branching into modern frameworks like React and game engines like Godot. As I continue to grow as a developer, I aim to deepen my expertise in both software engineering and systems programming, while taking on projects that challenge me to learn new tools and approaches.
